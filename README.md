## Siamese Signature Verificator
# Deep Siamese Inception Neural Network for Off-Line Signature Verification.

This repository presents a Siamese Neural Networks to help solving the off-line signature verification problem against random forgeries. 

Our proposed solution is writer-independent, and it can be used on new signers without any additional training. 

We tested our approach on the SigComp11 dataset and achieved 4% of ERR in verification which demonstrates the generalization capabilities of our proposal.

# Installation

```
pip install requirements.txt

python verification_server.py
```

# Test the system working

Using this [link](http://193.147.52.134:9000/) you can test the system working. To do that, first you have to create two PNG images with the signatures to be compared.
